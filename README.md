# App Academy's Harvard Art Museum Practice

This app has no styling on purpose. It is an exercise for nested routing and basic React using React Router 6.

Feel free to practice styling with this app, break it and repair it, and study it to learn RR6 syntax.

Note: esLint is aggressive on this app. There will be lots of commented out code as alternative ways to do things. Consequently, there will be corresponding linting errors for unused variables.
